# motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list
# to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a
# Honda motorcycle.”

motorcycles = ['harley davidson','honda','suzuki','royal enfield']

print(f"I would love to have a {motorcycles[3].title()} motorcycle.")
print(f"My brother has a {motorcycles[1].title()} motorcyle.")
print(f"My mom wants a new {motorcycles[0].title()} motorcycle.")
